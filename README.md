Laptop - ArchLinux
===========

This github repository is going to be contineously updated as I keep working on my
archlinux installation. All dotfiles, config files and relevant explanations will be included.

** Base installation

For my base installation, I have decided to go with the Evo/Lution live Arch-installer. Hardcore archers might find this a bit cheaty, but I like it for it's ease of use. I've decided to run with the Gnome+Extras window manager. Had I gone with a tiling window manager, my tiler of choice would be the i3-wm. I might do a separate guide on i3.
