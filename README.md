Laptop - ArchLinux
===========

This github repository is going to be contineously updated as I keep working on my
archlinux installation. All dotfiles, config files and relevant explanations will be included.

## Base installation

For my base installation, I have decided to go with the Evo/Lution live Arch-installer. Hardcore archers might find this a bit cheaty, but I like it for it's ease of use. I've decided to run with the Gnome+Extras window manager. Had I gone with a tiling window manager, my tiler of choice would be the i3-wm. I might do a separate guide on i3.

* Download Evo/Lution ISO

The Evo/Lution ISO can be downloaded from http://www.evolutionlinux.com/. Proceed by burning it to DVD or a bootable USB device and boot into it on restart.

* Install

Proceed with the installation as prompted. Chosing Gnome+Extras as your window manager when asked.
